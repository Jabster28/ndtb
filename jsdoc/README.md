## The New DT (cannon) Bot

This is the documentation for the New DT Cannon Bot that I've been developing. If you want to control the bot and came here by mistake, [click here to go back.](../admin)

### Quick disclaimer

Before you delve into my code, let me warn you that **NodeJS/Typescript is by no means a good platform for making a tetris bot** and that **I did not make this code as efficient as I probably could have**. I only did this in TypeScript because I knew it would be possible, and it was more of a thought experiment rather than an actual project. However, making such an intriguing bot in something so inefficient as TypeScript was something I didn't spend too much time thinking about as I got to work with my armada of `if` statements.

So yeah, don't expect this to run well if you try it at home.

I also haven't added calibration for other screen sizes/machines (yet), but you can quickly [read through this](tutorial-calibrate.html) if you want to try this at home.
